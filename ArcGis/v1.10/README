version 1.10 - tested with version ArcGIS 10.3 , 10.4
version 1.00 - tested with version ArcGIS 10.3 , 10.4


Changelog:

version 1.10: In this version we fixed some bugs regarding the file path names and outputs. Based on many feedback from our users, We also changed the tool to output a non-directed edgelist with only one row for each edge as our edgelists do not include information related to directed graphs. Users who need to include such information can modify the model to adapt to their specific needs.

version 1.00: First version of GISF2E that creates an edgelist from openStreetMaps data. This version outputs a directed edgelist with two rows for each edge. This would allow for inclusion of edge information such as oneway or lane speeds.
